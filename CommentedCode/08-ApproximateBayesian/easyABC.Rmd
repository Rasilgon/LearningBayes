Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a relatively new method that allows treating any stochastic model (IBM, stochastic population model, …) in a statistical framework by generating “approximate” likelihood values through simulating from the model. We provide a gentle introduction to ABC and some alternative approaches in our recent Ecology Letters review on “statisitical inference for stochastic simulation models”.

ABC has a huge potential as a solution for many typical ecological problems, but to make this more widely known is currently hindered by the fact that you have to code everything by hand, which excludes a large number of users.

The EasyABC package, available from CRAN (developed by Franck Jabot, Thierry Faure, Nicolas Dumoulin and maintained by Nicolas Dumoulin.), implements a number of algorithms for the three main sampling strategies used in ABC, namely Rejection Sampling, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). All those are also discussed in our review. The use of the package is relatively straightforward. 


Let's create some training data, assuming that there are 10 samples of a normal distribution with mean 5.3 and sd 2.7
```{r first}
# Load library
library(EasyABC)

#create data
data =  rnorm(10, mean =5.3, sd = 2.7)
```
<br />
We want to use ABC to infer the parameters that were used. We sample from the same model and use mean and variance as summary statstitics for the model and the data.
 
```{r second}

# observed summary statistics
summarydata = c(mean(data), sd(data))
 
# stochastic model generates a sample for given par and returns summary statistics
model <- function(par){ 
  samples <- rnorm(10, mean =par[1], sd = par[2])
  return(c(mean(samples), sd(samples)))
}
```

<br />
Now we call to EasyABC with the ABC-MCMC algorithm with some automatic adjustment options 


```{r ABC}
ABC_Marjoram_original<-ABC_mcmc(method="Marjoram", model=model, 
  prior=list(c("unif",0,10),c("unif",1,5)), 
  summary_stat_target=summarydata, n_rec = 10000)
 
str(ABC_Marjoram_original)
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
hist(ABC_Marjoram_original$param[5000:10000,1], main = "Posterior for mean")
hist(ABC_Marjoram_original$param[5000:10000,2], main = "Posterior for standard deviation")
```
<br />
<br />
